    <p style="margin-top:50px;">Kim Min-jae picked up the first assist of his Serie A career on Sunday as Napoli romped to another 3-0 win over Cremonese at home in Naples, Italy.</p>
    <P>Napoli made short work of the visitors who, despite being in last place in the league by some margin, are one of only three sides to beat the Partenopei across all competitions this season. That shock loss was in the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia, a tournament Cremonese are still in and set to face Fiorentina in the semifinals.
    But there was no chance of a repeat of the Coppa Italia exit this week. Napoli manager Luciano Spalletti learned from the mistake of fielding a weaker side last time around, this time opting for the full Napoli starting XI that has risen to become one of the top teams in Europe this season.</P>
    <p>Khvicha Kvaratskhelia struck first, celebrating his 22nd birthday with a low shot that Cremonese goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi couldn't get near.
    Kvaratskhelia's 21st-minute effort was the only goal in the first half, but Napoli piled on after the break.</p>
    <p>Kim's involvement came on the second goal, when Carnesecchi managed to save a set piece effort from Giovanni Di Lorenzo, only to send the ball in the always-dangerous vicinity of Kim's head.
    Rather than making an attempt on goal himself, Kim saw that Victor Osimhen had room and headed the ball across the goal mouth for the Serie A leading goal scorer to fire home.</p>
    <p>Elif Elmas added goal No. 3 in the 79th minute to round off the 3-0 victory and kick off yet another night of celebrations in Naples.</p>
    <p>With 22 games now played, Spalletti's Napoli are 16 points clear at the top of the Serie A table as of press time Monday, although second-place Inter Milan still have a game to play later on the same day.
    Napoli's lead at this point in the season is starting to look genuinely insurmountable, with even a spectacular collapse in form needing to last a full six games to knock the Partenopei off the top spot.</p>
    <p>“There is total commitment, we have good lads as well as great professionals, they are all ready to tire themselves out to help the team,” Spalletti said after the game. “They must be ready to destroy themselves on the pitch to get a result, because a result makes the difference.
    “Our city and these fans are keeping us on our toes, because everyone feels the desire to win. Perhaps we felt it a bit too much in the first half, as there was some tension, we didn't pass the ball the way we usually do and Cremonese used their tactics with these very wide wing-backs to make us use up energy chasing them down and defending.
    “It was much better after the break, passing with more quality, calm and organization, because that is what we need to do with our characteristics.”</p>
    <p>Napoli will next face Sassuolo in a Serie A clash on Friday, scheduled early to allow room for Spalletti and the squad to travel to Germany for the resumption of UEFA Champions League action next week.
    Napoli will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the away leg of their two-leg round of 16 clash in Frankfurt on Feb. 21.  
    With just three games lost across all competitions so far this season, Napoli remain one of the favorites to win the Champions League this year — although Spalletti refuses to speculate.
    “We have to take it one game at a time,” the Napoli manager said. “Some are trying to make us think we've already won, that we will get who knows what, but we need to stay focused and keep the attention on every detail. As I said before, you live on the present, not the future.”</p>
